## ShorelineS-cloud

This repository is a fork of the original ShorelineS project:
https://github.com/danoroelvink/shorelines

It contains modifications to support integration with the web & cloud-based simulation software of Scientia Maris and the ShorelineS cloud web interface.

The example scripts are able to function with the modified source code as the original ShorelineS code.
